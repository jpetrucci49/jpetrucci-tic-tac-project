Technologies used in this project include HTML, SASS, Javascript, Jquery, and the DOM.

My plan for coding this Tic-Tac-Toe game was to segment the project into different features to implement. Firstly, login functionality including sign in, sign up, change password and sign out. Secondly, add game logic to recursively test if my win conditions have been met. Finally, to implement action handlers for click events within the game scope.

My development process was labored, and riddled with bugs of all varieties, from grunt, to github, to poor variable definition.

My problem solving strategy was straight forward. Read error reports, ask my bestest buddy, Google what any of it meant, then apply appropriate use of hammer to my code until the pieces fit.

One bug I have found in development and testing is that if click is spammed, or mouseDown is dragged to another cell for mouseUp, it will break the game grid layout.

User stories:
